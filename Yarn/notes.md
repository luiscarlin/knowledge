## Notes

* by facebbook
* package versions locked by default (no need to run `npm shrinkwrap` anymore)
* faster than `npm` because it keeps local cache of packages
* because of cache, it can be used offline (even if your `node_modules` folder is deleted)
* you can check on validity of dependencies
